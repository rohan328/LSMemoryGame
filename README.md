## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
    * W3Schools

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
    * Had an issue getting the random number function to work. I am used to the C++ function which generates random ints whereas javascript generates numbers from 0-1.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
    * I have prior experience with web development so I don't have any specific questions.
    
4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
    * I would make it difficult for the player to win by adding longer sequnces and an option to choose the max sequence length and improving the overall looks of the game.
